Bheard
========================

Yet another social commenting/feedback application to allow people
to review, vote and join the discussion on changes and issues that
are impacting the location within which they live.

This app is in very early stages, where I am currently focused on selecting
the correct gems and getting the framework in place before focusing on the
functionality, ie it is as much of playground for looking at some new gems
and rails 4 and implementing traits as it as about the functionality, which
will come after.
